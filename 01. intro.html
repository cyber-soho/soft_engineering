    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is designed as an interactive study guide, not a linear document. The structure is thematic, with a persistent navigation bar allowing users to jump between core concepts. This non-linear approach encourages exploration and comparison, which is more effective for learning than passive reading. Key interactive features include: 1) A toggleable chart comparing hardware vs. software failure curves. 2) An interactive diagram of the engineering layers. 3) A core "Process Model Comparator" tool that allows users to select different models (Waterfall, Scrum, etc.) and see their flows, strengths, weaknesses, and ideal use-cases update dynamically. This is the centerpiece, designed to make abstract models tangible and comparable. This structure was chosen to transform a static lecture into an active learning experience. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 1. Software vs. Hardware Failure: Goal is to compare. A toggleable Line Chart (Chart.js/Canvas) is used to visually contrast the "bathtub" curve with the "deterioration" curve. Interaction is toggling datasets. Justification: A direct visual comparison is more impactful than two separate static images. 2. Engineering Layers: Goal is to organize. An interactive diagram built with HTML/Tailwind is used. Interaction is hovering/clicking to reveal details. Justification: This shows the hierarchy and relationship between layers more effectively than a list. 3. Process Models: Goal is to compare and organize. A dynamic content block powered by JS selectors is the main feature. Visuals for each model are built with HTML/CSS. Interaction is selecting a model to view its details. Justification: This is the most effective way to allow students to directly compare and contrast complex, abstract models in a self-paced manner. 4. Principles: Goal is to inform. Presented as interactive cards. Justification: Breaks down a long list into digestible chunks. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
